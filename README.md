This is a  sample To-Do list app made using HTML, CSS and Jquery.
This app runs on localhost and the memory is lost once browser is closed.
First page is the landing page and on clicking a button you will be redirected to the main page 
where you can add or remove tasks and there is a corresponding task counter and a delete button with each task.
There is also a delete all button which will delete all tasks and also reset the counter to 0.
This is a basic project done in order to showcase HTML, CSS and JQuery knowledge.
